# BOTCOM

I wrote this project over the span of 2 weeks after about 1 week of reading a lot of material about HTNs used in Real-Time Strategy games.
I'd like to revisit this in the future and eventually get to the point where it is plug-and-play for Arma 3 mission makers to use in their
own missions, as well as fix some of the issues it currently has.

Included is my write-up explaining the research I did as well as how the task network operates and my design thinking.
